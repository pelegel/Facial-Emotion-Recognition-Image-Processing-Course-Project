# Final Project in mage Processing and Analysis Course at Ben Gurion University

In this project, we have decided to explore the task of image emotion classification, in particular, happy, angry and sad – three very common emotions. Understanding and identifying those emotions is a crucial aspect in 
many fields, such as human-robots interaction, and effectively classifying them can improve those interfaces.

Another aspect of image processing, is using different image processing techniques that could, hopefully, help the model to better understand the different classes’ patterns, and improve the performances of the
learning models in classifying the emotions expressed in the images.

This leads us to our project’s research question: 
Can we use image processing techniques for the task of image emotion classification, and whether there are preprocessing techniques that will improve the classification?

The repository contains three types of files:
1. three folders with samples of images from 3 classes (Angry, Happy, Sad)
2. Python Code (pre-processing, funcations, modeling, evaluations, etc.)
3. PDF article summarizes the research process, method and the results.
